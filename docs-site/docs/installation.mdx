### 3. Install with pipx (Isolated Installation)

Then configure your API key:
```bash
reqsmith config set ai.gemini_api_key "your-api-key-here"
```

pip install PyYAML
```

## Environment Variables

You can override configuration using environment variables:

```

See `reqsmith config env` for a full list of available environment variables.
